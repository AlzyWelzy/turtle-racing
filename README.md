# Turtle Racing Game

This is a simple turtle racing game built with Python's `turtle` module. The game prompts the user to input the number of racers (between 2 and 10), and then randomly assigns colors to the turtles. The turtles race across the screen, with the first one to reach the top being declared the winner.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Run the `main.py` file
3. Enter the number of racers when prompted
4. Watch the race!

## Requirements

This game requires Python 3 and the `turtle` module.
