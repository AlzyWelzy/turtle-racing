# Turtle Racing Game

This is a simple turtle racing game built with Python's `turtle` module. The game prompts the user to input the number of racers (between 2 and 10), and then randomly assigns colors to the turtles. The turtles race across the screen, with the first one to reach the top being declared the winner.
